The following is a list of useful consumable items we currently can't get enough of.

- [LOCTITE 454](http://www.loctite.co.uk/loctite-4087.htm?nodeid=8802626109441) -- For gluing the agar block to the slide.
-  2-part Epoxy for gluing the magnets to the slide. The following are known to work: Araldite Rapid 5 min, Araldite Crystal. 
- [Campden 752/1/SS](https://campdeninstruments.com/products/stainless-steel-blades-50) -- Stainless steel razor blades for cutting the samples. Cut wonderfully and don't rust.  
- [Block magnets](https://www.supermagnete.ch/eng/block-magnets-neodymium/block-magnet-22mm-x-8.5mm-x-1.4mm-neodymium-35sh-nickel-plated_Q-22-8.5-1.4-SHN) -- These are easy to glue to the slide since you need just one. They corrode a little in the bath but this isn't problematic. 
- [Copper EM grids](http://www.2spi.com/item/2145c-xa/) for [measuring x/y resolution](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/TissueVisionMods/wiki/Measuring-X-Y-resolution). You can image the grid directly at 920 nm.
- [Autofluorescent plastic slides](https://www.chroma.com/products/accessories/92001-autofluorescent-plastic-slides) -- really handy for checking field uniformity and alignment. Image them at a **very low** laser power. They emit a lot of light at the right wavelength.

Since we began serial-section two photon imaging with the TissueCyte, we have been covalently bonding the brain to the agarose. 
Whilst it's not clear whether the brains slices themselves adhere better to the agar after this procedure, the agar certainly does become slightly more rigid and this would appear to assist in cutting thinner sections. 

We make available our protocol in [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/posts/CovalentAgaroseEmbedding.pdf) format, along with the [LaTeX source file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/posts/CovalentAgaroseEmbedding.tex), should you wish to modify the text.

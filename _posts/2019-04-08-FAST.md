In 2017, Seiriki et al. published [a paper in Neuron](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317304555?via%3Dihub) describing a serial section spinning disk confocal named "FAST". 
The approached seemed useful but the paper did not go into much detail on the protocol. 
Today, the same authors publish detailed information on their system in [Nature Protocols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0148-4). 
This new paper goes into substantial detail on how to build the setup and supplies code to run the microscope.

Recent work by [Winnubst and colleagues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419308426) reconstructs 1000 cortical neurons using their resonant-scanning serial section 2-photon system first described in [Economo et al (2016)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/105660). Better yet, the new paper is published alongside much better on-line resources for the hardware itself. The new [MouseLight](https://github.com/MouseLightPipeline) GitHub team hosts the data-processing pipeline. Yet more code is in [MouseLightProject](https://github.com/MouseLightProject/), where you can find [Fetch](https://github.com/MouseLightProject/MouseLight_Microscope_Software), the microscope control software. The code is now better documented than in earlier releases.

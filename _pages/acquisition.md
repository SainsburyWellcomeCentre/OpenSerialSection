    title: "BakingTray: serial-section acquisition software"
    excerpt: "BakingTray is modular serial-section acquisition software for MATLAB. It can easily be modified to utilize any desired acquisition hardware (scanners, stages, etc). Images are currently acquired with [ScanImage](http://vidriotechnologies.com), but BakingTray can easily be extended to work with any acquisition system (e.g. a spinning-disk confocal or your own scanning software). BakingTray is more of a research platform for catalyzing developments in serial section imaging than a complete turn-key system."

    excerpt: "Pre-processes data during acquisition, streams the last stitched section to a web page, initiates stitching automatically when acquisition completes. Includes tools for downsampling and generally batch-processing image stacks. Operations highly parallelized for speed."

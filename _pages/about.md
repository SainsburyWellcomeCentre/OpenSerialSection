This site brings together open source tools used at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (UCL) for acquisition, analysis, and visualisation of serial section imaging data. 
We make available both published and unpublished software via our [Serial2P](https://github.com/orgs/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/teams/serial2p/repositories) GitHub team. The main highlights are:

* We describe how [to modify commercial systems](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/TissueVisionMods/wiki) in order to run [open source acquisition software](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/BakingTray). 
* [StitchIt](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/StitchIt), our modular tile stitcher for MATLAB
* [Registration to the Allen Atlas](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/OpenSerialSection/registration/)
* A blog organised by [date]({{ site.baseurl }}/year), by [tag]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags), or by [category]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories)
